- Stochastic oscillator

1. On-Balance Volume (OBV)
      Positive and negative flow of volume over time.
2. Coherence between OBV and price: if they go on different directions then a "divergence" is happening (could soon reverse).
3. Accumulation/distribution line (A/D)
      Shows if the stocks close near its high.
4. Coherence between A/D and price: trend might reverse, signaling "divergence".
5. Average Directional Index (ADX)
      Measures strength and momentum: ADX>40 -> a lot of directional strength
        ADX<20 -> weak trend or non-trending

      Using also DI+ and D-:
	. ADX above 20 and DI+ above DI-: That's an uptrend.
        . ADX above 20 and DI- above DI+: That's a downtrend.
        . ADX below 20 is a weak trend or ranging period, often associated with the DI- and DI+ rapidly crisscrossing each other.
6. Aroon indicator:
       Two lines: Aroon-up, Aroon-down. A cross between them and staying in the borders imply a trend. Ex: Aroon-up hits 100 and stays relatively close to that level while the Aroon-down stays near zero, that is positive confirmation of an uptrend.
7. Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD)
       Two lines: signal and MACD, a cross indicates trend.
---------------------------------------------------------
8. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
      RSI>70: asset overbought and could decline.
      RSI<30: asset oversold and could rally.
      Sometimes expects to rise over 70 and then drop before selling, drop below 30 and then rise back before buying.
9. RSI divergence with price: trend is weakening and could soon reverse.
10. RSI as support and resistance.
      RSI>30 hitting 70 means uptrends.
      RSI<70 and hitting 30 means downtrends.
11. Stochastic oscillator
      Checks if the price hits new highs and lows.
      SO>80: overbought. If drop bak is short trade.
      SO<20: oversold. If rises back is a buy signal.
12. Schaff Trend Cycle (STC)
      Similar to MACD but takes into consideration a cycle component.
13. Bollinger bands
      If the price moves outside the upper parameters it could be overbought. Moving below the lower band means oversold.
14. Fibonacci retracement
15. Ichimoku cloud
16. Standard deviation
